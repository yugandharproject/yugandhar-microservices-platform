# Yugandhar Microservice Platform

Yugandhar Microservice Platform (referred as Yugandhar MSP) provides framework for rapid development of your Microservice. This is an architecturally proven Springboot based application having all the basic components needed for a Microservice application to work which just needs to be extended as per your requirements.

Yugandhar Microservice platform comes with code generation templates for rapid application development. Design your data model and generate the code using Yugandhar templates, your base table services will be ready. To create the composite services, you may have to write a few lines of code but it would take minimal efforts. Your new Microservice would be ready in just a few hours.

The Yugandhar MSP supports embedded Web Server (EWS) as well as JEE container web servers (JEEC), the functionality is tested with Tomcat and Jboss EAP. Yugandhar MSP supports wide veriety of databases currently in the market and is tested against MariaDB and Oracle 11g/12c.

One can do the development with Minimal development environment having eclipse, maven and mariadb/oracle database. The Yugandhar MSP makes the life easy as it can be build using maven. Yugandhar MSP is cloud ready and it can be deployed using docker on cloud platform like AWS or any other private cloud.

Wait is just over, clone the MSP source code repository, make customization and deploy on the go!!
